# Remove-Riot-Vanguard-BATCH-
Removes Riot Vanguard anticheat, for you to be able to uninstall Valorant afterwards. Made this for extremely lazy people, don't know why this would be used otherwise.

Make sure to run both part 1 part 2, in their order.
Make sure to run with admin permissions.

Not obfuscated, check the code yourself if you wish.

Requires a restart from part 1, that's why there's 2 parts.
